## 🔧 Important Notes

### About the Backend

The current setup uses **in-memory storage**, which means:
- ✅ Perfect for testing and sharing with friends
- ✅ Free and instant deployment
- ⚠️ CDs will be lost if the server restarts (happens occasionally on free tier)
- ⚠️ Not suitable for long-term storage

**For Production (Optional):**
If you want permanent storage, you'll need to add a database. Options:
- Vercel KV (Redis)
- MongoDB Atlas (free tier)
- Supabase (free tier)

Let me know if you want help setting up permanent storage!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
- Make sure `package.json` is uploaded to GitHub

### API not working
- Check that `vercel.json` is properly configured
- Make sure `server.js` is in the root directory

### CDs not saving
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify the deployment succeeded on Vercel dashboard

### YouTube videos not playing
- This is normal for some videos (copyright restrictions)
- The app will auto-skip to the next track

## 🔄 Updating Your App

After making changes:

```bash
cd /Users/chandlerhansen/Downloads/mystery-cd-app

# Make your changes to files, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy! ⚡

## 💰 Costs

Everything is **100% FREE** with these limitations:
- Vercel Free: 100GB bandwidth/month (plenty for personal use)
- GitHub: Unlimited public repos
- No credit card required!

## 🎨 Custom Domain (Optional)

Want a custom URL like `mycd.com` instead of `mystery-cd-player.vercel.app`?

1. Buy a domain from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) or [Google Domains](https://domains.google)
2. Go to Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Domains
3. Add your custom domain and follow the DNS instructions
